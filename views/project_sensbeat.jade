      h3 Sensbeat - Startup
      p I joined Sensbeat team when I was just year one in university. All my stories begin from <strong>Sensbeat</strong>. It is, and will always be, the most important memory in my life.
      p.quote ‚ÄúTwo road diverged in a wood and i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference.‚Äù
      p Many new opportunities opened up here, and that's make me a not-so-university student - we fighted for fundings, traveled thousands miles from home to explore new opportunties,
        | worked, iterated over and over to see how far we could be.
      p Originally joined the team as an intern, soon after I picked up the mobile application development, I become one of the co-founding team members.
        | It's not very common for university students in Hong Kong to commit a Full-time position, especially startup, because there are so many things to sacrifice - Grades, and more grades.
        | I can't remember how many semesters are ended with merely passing grade like 1.x 2.x.
        
      p Gaining some traction in Hong Kong, we secured not only fundings but also some advisors from U.S, which later encouraged us to explore to foreign market.

      h3 OMV - Film Your Music Video, with Lyrics
      p OMV was started as a side-project back to the time staying in Silicon Valley. Inspired by the success of Musical.ly, I believe
        | music video and lyrics would be an excellent combination for users in Asia especially countries speaking Chinese.
        
      p I quickly formed a team of two to fast prototyping the product in 3 weeks. Different from Sensbeat main product, OMV was
        | entirely developed in <strong>Swift</strong>. 
        
      p OMV leveraged heavily on AVFoudation framework which is built with iOS SDK, as well as GPUImage, Alamofire, PromiseKit, and a number of open source libraries.

    p Soon after the prototyping success and positive feedbacks from lead users, Sensbeat decided to pivot to OMV app.
    p OMV somehow gained a good traction in China which grow 50% in 3 iterations with 70k downloads on app store.
